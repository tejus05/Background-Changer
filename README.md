# Background-Changer

This React project is a simple color-changing app. It features a full-screen background div whose color can be altered by clicking on color buttons located in a fixed bar at the bottom of the screen. Each button changes the background color with a smooth transition, thanks to the use of the useState hook and event handlers.
